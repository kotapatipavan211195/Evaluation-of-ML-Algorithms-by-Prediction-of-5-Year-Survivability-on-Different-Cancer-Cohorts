# Comprehensive Evaluation of ML Algorithms by Prediction of 5 Year Survivability on Different Cancer Cohorts
Performed a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models for prediction of 5-year cancer survivability on different cancer cohorts by using the SEER public database. 
In this project, performed feature selection process, eliminated clinically irrelevant values, implemented Stratified K-fold cross validation along with sampling techniques like Random Over Sampling and Random Under Sampling on the training data sets to remove bias and overfitting.
