# Evaluation-of-ML-Algorithms-by-Prediction-of-5-Year-Survivability-on-Different-Cancer-Cohorts
Using SEER cancer data by selecting the required features and then finally creating the dependent variable, prediction of 5-year survivability of cancer and then comparing the models to see the one with better performance and also applying the sampling techniques to improve the performance of the models to remove the bias in the models.
